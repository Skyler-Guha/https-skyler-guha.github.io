    <ul>
      <li>This is my entry for the kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" ML codeing challenge.</li>
      <li>The aim here was to predict if a passenger survived or not based on the available information on them.</li>
      <li>This challenge involved data exploration and cleaning, as well as the use of ML clasification techniques.</li>
      <li>I made the use of neural networks for my predictions.</li>
      <li>It is writen in Python.</li>
