    <h2>Digit Drawing And Recognizing Program</h2>
    <img src="https://github.com/Skyler-Guha/skyler-guha.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/digit-drawing-and-recognizing-program-demo.gif" width="700" alt="A gif of the program in action">
    <ul>
      <li>It is a program that allows the user to draw a digit and clasify it as well as save the image data and index through existing saved data.</li>
      <li>It uses the MNIST digits dataset for traiining and a self made dataset for testing that was collected  in person from randoom individuals.</li>
      <li>This program was originally made as part of my collage major project.</li>
      <li>I made the use of neural networks for my predictions.</li>

    <h2>Titanic Survival Prediction</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Titanic_in_color.png" width="700" alt="Image of titanic">
    <ul>
      <li>This is my entry for the kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" ML codeing challenge.</li>
      <li>The aim here was to predict if a passenger survived or not based on the available information on them.</li>
      <li>This challenge involved data exploration and cleaning, as well as the use of ML clasification techniques.</li>
      <li>I made the use of neural networks for my predictions.</li>
